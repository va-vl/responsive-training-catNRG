# Responsive CatNRG

https://va-z.github.io/responsive-training-catNRG/

A learning project somewhat based on a ready template for a fictional cat food store's responsive website. Creative liberites taken with some grid elements, etc. Gulpfile is a mess. First time uploading to github, so that's a cluster too. Bleh.
